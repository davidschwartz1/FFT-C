# FFT - The Fast Fourier Transform

This project illustrates how to successfully test-drive an algorithm-based software solution that employs techniques from electrical engineering and signal processing.

The objective is to implement an FFT library that performs a radix-2 decimation-in-time FFT of a signal. The bit-reversal operations need to be lean, and the FFT evaluation loops need to be efficient for general use.
